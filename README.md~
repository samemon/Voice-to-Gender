REQUIREMENTS:

To run the voice2gender.py program, you would need the following libraries:
- keras
- numpy
- sox (python library via pip install sox)
- scipy

Once you have installed the above requirements (using pip install), you can run the 
program as follows:

$ python voice2gender.py <full path to the wav file>

The above program will print 0/1 where 0 == Male, 1 == Female

PS. If the model does not load due to the error "Can't load_model with error â€œOptimizer weight shape [..]", then you would need to create a python file in this directory with the following code

############################################
import glob
import h5py

model_files = sorted(glob.glob('*.h5'))
for model_file in model_files:
    print("Update '{}'".format(model_file))
    with h5py.File(model_file, 'a') as f:
        if 'optimizer_weights' in f.keys():
            del f['optimizer_weights']
###########################################

After running the above program, you should try to run the program again.
